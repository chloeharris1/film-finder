## Description 

A JavaScript project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer career path.

In this project, I am using HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You‚Äôll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

Obfuscating the API key was outside the scope of this project, so my key is publicly available. Best practice would be to build a back-end or middleware in order to keep the key private.
